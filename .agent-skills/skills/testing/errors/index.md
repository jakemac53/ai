# Handling errors in Flutter

The Flutter framework catches errors that occur during callbacks
triggered by the framework itself, including errors encountered
during the build, layout, and paint phases. Errors that don't occur
within Flutter's callbacks can't be caught by the framework,
but you can handle them by setting up an error handler on the
[`PlatformDispatcher`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher-class.html).


All errors caught by Flutter are routed to the
[`FlutterError.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/FlutterError/onError.html)
handler. By default,
this calls [`FlutterError.presentError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/FlutterError/presentError.html),
which dumps the error to the device logs.
When running from an IDE, the inspector overrides this
behavior so that errors can also be routed to the IDE's
console, allowing you to inspect the
objects mentioned in the message.


infoNote

Consider calling [`FlutterError.presentError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/FlutterError/presentError.html)

from your custom error handler in order to see
the logs in the console as well.


When an error occurs during the build phase,
the [`ErrorWidget.builder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ErrorWidget/builder.html)
callback is
invoked to build the widget that is used
instead of the one that failed. By default,
in debug mode this shows an error message in red,
and in release mode this shows a gray background.


When errors occur without a Flutter callback on the call stack,
they are handled by the `PlatformDispatcher`'s error callback. By default,
this only prints errors and does nothing else.


You can customize these behaviors,
typically by setting them to values in
your `void main()` function.


Below each error type handling is explained. At the bottom
there's a code snippet which handles all types of errors. Even
though you can just copy-paste the snippet, we recommend you
to first get acquainted with each of the error types.


## Errors caught by Flutter

[#](#errors-caught-by-flutter)

For example, to make your application quit immediately any time an
error is caught by Flutter in release mode, you could use the
following handler:


dart

```
import 'dart:io';
​
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
​
void main() {
  FlutterError.onError = (details) {
    FlutterError.presentError(details);
    if (kReleaseMode) exit(1);
  };
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
​
// The rest of the `flutter create` code...

```

infoNote

The top-level [`kReleaseMode`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kReleaseMode-constant.html)
constant indicates
whether the app was compiled in release mode.


This handler can also be used to report errors to a logging service.
For more details, see our cookbook chapter for
[reporting errors to a service](/cookbook/maintenance/error-reporting).


## Define a custom error widget for build phase errors

[#](#define-a-custom-error-widget-for-build-phase-errors)

To define a customized error widget that displays whenever
the builder fails to build a widget, use [`MaterialApp.builder`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/builder.html).


dart

```
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: (context, widget) {
        Widget error = const Text('...rendering error...');
        if (widget is Scaffold || widget is Navigator) {
          error = Scaffold(body: Center(child: error));
        }
        ErrorWidget.builder = (errorDetails) => error;
        if (widget != null) return widget;
        throw StateError('widget is null');
      },
    );
  }
}

```

content\_copy

## Errors not caught by Flutter

[#](#errors-not-caught-by-flutter)

Consider an `onPressed` callback that invokes an asynchronous function,
such as `MethodChannel.invokeMethod` (or pretty much any plugin).
For example:


dart

```
OutlinedButton(
  child: const Text('Click me!'),
  onPressed: () async {
    const channel = MethodChannel('crashy-custom-channel');
    await channel.invokeMethod('blah');
  },
)

```

content\_copy

If `invokeMethod` throws an error, it won't be forwarded to `FlutterError.onError`.
Instead, it's forwarded to the `PlatformDispatcher`.


To catch such an error, use [`PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html).


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:ui';
​
void main() {
  MyBackend myBackend = MyBackend();
  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (error, stack) {
    myBackend.sendError(error, stack);
    return true;
  };
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

```

## Handling all types of errors

[#](#handling-all-types-of-errors)

Say you want to exit application on any exception and to display
a custom error widget whenever a widget building fails - you can base
your errors handling on next code snippet:


dart

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'dart:ui';
​
Future<void> main() async {
  await myErrorsHandler.initialize();
  FlutterError.onError = (details) {
    FlutterError.presentError(details);
    myErrorsHandler.onErrorDetails(details);
  };
  PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (error, stack) {
    myErrorsHandler.onError(error, stack);
    return true;
  };
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
​
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});
​
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      builder: (context, widget) {
        Widget error = const Text('...rendering error...');
        if (widget is Scaffold || widget is Navigator) {
          error = Scaffold(body: Center(child: error));
        }
        ErrorWidget.builder = (errorDetails) => error;
        if (widget != null) return widget;
        throw StateError('widget is null');
      },
    );
  }
}

```
