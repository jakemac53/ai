# 0.1.3 (Dart SDK 3.12.0) - WIP

- Add additional analytics for initialization events, and various list\* method
  calls. This will help understand how the server is being used by different
  clients, and what features clients support.
- Add a tool for running ripgrep on package dependencies.
- Add `categories` for MCP features, allowing enabling/disabling tools by
  category or name.
  - This replaces the now deprecated `--tools` and `--exclude-tool` flags, but
    both are still supported for backward compatibility. `--tools=dart` now
    becomes `--disable=flutter` and `--exclude-tool` is just an alias for
    `--disable`.
- Add `timeout` option to `launch_app`.
- Add `args` parameter to `launch_app` to support passing additional flags to
  `flutter run` (e.g. `--flavor`, `--dart-define`, `--dart-define-from-file`).
  Managed flags (`--print-dtd`, `--machine`, `--device-id`, `--target`, `-d`,
  `-t`) are blocked and must be passed via their dedicated parameters instead.
- The `read_package_uris` tool now supports resolving the `package-root:` scheme
  to read package structure beyond the `lib/` directory.
- The `read_package_uris` tool now returns flattened text and image `Content`
  payloads when traversing directories and symlinks rather than `ResourceLink`s
  or embedded resources. This has better support across all clients.
- Fix nested finder JSON serialization for Ancestor/Descendant finders in the
  `flutter_driver` tool ([issue #345](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/issues/345)).
- Fix `analyze_files` returning false "No errors" when `paths` parameter is specified.
- Merge `get_selected_widget`, `get_widget_tree`, `set_widget_selection_mode` into `widget_inspector` tool.
- Merge `hover`, `signatureHelp`, `resolveWorkspaceSymbol` into `lsp` tool.

# 0.1.2 (Dart SDK 3.11.0)

- Add `--tools=dart|all` argument to allow enabling only vanilla Dart tools for
  non-flutter projects.
- Include the device name and target platform in the list_devices tool.
- Fix analyze tool handling of invalid roots.
- Fix erroneous SDK version error messages when connecting to a VM Service
  instead of DTD URI.
- Add a tool for reading package: URIs. Results are returned as embedded
  resources or resource links (when reading a directory).
- Add `additionalProperties: false` to most schemas so they provide better
  errors when invoked with incorrect arguments.
- Add `DartMcpServer.samplingRequest` service extension method to send a sampling
  request over DTD.
- Fix the `timeout` parameter for the flutter_driver tool to be a String,
  matching the underlying expected type (issue #330).

# 0.1.1 (Dart SDK 3.10.0)

- Change tools that accept multiple roots to not return immediately on the first
  failure.
- Add failure reason field to analytics events so we can know why tool calls are
  failing.
- Add a flutter_driver command for executing flutter driver commands on a device.
- Allow for multiple package arguments to `pub add` and `pub remove`.
- Require dart_mcp version 0.3.1.
- Add support for the flutter_driver screenshot command.
- Change the widget tree to the full version instead of the summary. The summary
  tends to hide nested text widgets which makes it difficult to find widgets
  based on their text values.
- Add an `--exclude-tool` command line flag to exclude tools by name.
- Add the abillity to limit the output of `analyze_files` to a set of paths.
- Stop reporting non-zero exit codes from command line tools as tool errors.
- Add descriptions for pub tools, add support for `pub deps` and `pub outdated`.
- Fix a bug in hot_reload ([#290](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/issues/290)).
- Add the `list_devices`, `launch_app`, `get_app_logs`, and `list_running_apps`
  tools for running Flutter apps.
- Add the `hot_restart` tool for restarting running Flutter apps.
- Add extra log output to failed launches, and allow AI to specify the maxLines
  of log output.
- Convert `launch_app` to use `--machine` output to capture the DTD URI.
- Remove a reference to "screenshot" for a generic error that occurs for more
  than just screenshots.
- Mark the "root" parameter for `create_project` required.

# 0.1.0 (Dart SDK 3.9.0)

- Add documentation/homepage/repository links to pub results.
- Handle relative paths under roots without trailing slashes.
- Fix executable paths for dart/flutter on windows.
- Pass the provided root instead of the resolved root for project type detection.
- Be more flexible about roots by comparing canonicalized paths.
- Create the working dir if it doesn't exist.
- Add the --platform and --empty arguments to the flutter create tool.
- Invoke dart/flutter in a more robust way.
- Remove qualifiedNames from the pub dev api search.
- Flutter/Dart create tool.
- Limit the tokens returned by the runtime errors tool/resource.
- Add RootsFallbackSupport mixin.
- Fix error handling around stream listeners.
- Add a 'pub-dev-search' mcp tool.
- Drop pubspec-parse, use yaml instead.
- Handle failing to listen to vm service streams during startup.
- Add tool for enabling/disabling the widget selector.
- Add a tool to get the active cursor location.
- Add hover tool support.
- Add a test command and project detection.
- Add signature_help tool.
- Add runtime errors resource and tool to clear errors.
- Require roots for all CLI tools.
- Require roots to be set for analyzer tools.
- Add debug logs for when DTD sees Editor.getDebugSessions get registered.
- Add tool annotations to tools.
- Implement a tool to resolve workspace symbols based on a query.
- Add a dart pub tool.
- Update analyze tool to use LSP, simplify tool.
- Add tool for getting the selected widget.
- Handle missing roots capability better.
- Add `get_widget_tree` tool.
- Add a tool for getting runtime errors.
- Add Dart CLI tool support.
- Add a hot reload tool.
- Add basic analysis support.
- Add the beginnings of a Dart tooling MCP server.
- Instruct clients to prefer MCP tools over running tools in the shell.
- Reduce output size of `run_tests` tool to save on input tokens.
- Add `--log-file` argument to log all protocol traffic to a file.
- Improve error text for failed DTD connections as well as the tool description.
- Add support for injecting an `Analytics` instance to track usage.
- Listen to the new DTD `ConnectedApp` service instead of the `Editor.DebugSessions`
  service, when available.
- Screenshot tool disabled until
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/170357 is resolved.
- Add `arg_parser.dart` public library with minimal deps to be used by the dart tool.
